5. XlsxWriter: Used to create and format Excel files, including setting cell styles, adding hyperlinks, and enabling custom formatting options.
6. Flask: A micro web framework for building web applications and APIs, used to set up endpoints and connect front-end forms to back-end data processing functions.
7. JavaScript (AJAX): Used on the front end to asynchronously send requests to the server without reloading the page, enabling a smoother user experience.
